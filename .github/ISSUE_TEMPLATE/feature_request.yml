      **Important Notes:**
      - Feature requests must align with HomeKit's intended functionality and Home Connect API capabilities.
      - Features outside the scope of HomeKit or Home Connect API are unlikely to be implemented.
      - Detailed, actionable suggestions, are more likely to be considered.
